# DBN-Drug-Target-Interaction
A tensorflow implementation of modified DeepDTI(http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00618). Besides using Protein Sequence Composition as the descriptors for proteins, I add the contact maps(for proteins with structures) and DI scores(for those without structures) as additional descriptors for proteins, which include some long range information  between amino acids in the porteins.
