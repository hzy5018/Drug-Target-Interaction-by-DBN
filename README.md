# Drug-Target-Interaction-by-DBN
## Introduction
- A tensorflow implementation of modified DeepDTI(http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00618).
- We focus on the pockets on proteins, instead of the whole sequences described in the paper.
- We explore data from CHEMBL for testing the model, instead of using the data from DrugBank.
